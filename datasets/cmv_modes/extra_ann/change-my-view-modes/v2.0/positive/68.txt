[NEWLINE] In short, my two points were : 1.  We could create a system that simply pointed to morally impermissible actions as illegal, but that would lead to large discrepancies ( or would need have some other system to define what is morally impermissible, out of scope of a high schooler's memory ).

[NEWLINE] [DELTA] I'm giving you a delta btw because thinking about it your post has made it obvious to me that the list of subcategories would be bigger than I initially anticipated, and might itself be a pretty significant feat of memorization.
