[NEWLINE] Because of the anonymity on 4chan people are more prone to not think through, care about what they post and are quicker to throw out insults.

[NEWLINE] They will care about how people respond to them, but since it's largely negative they will stoop down to the same level rather than go to any high ground since they are not linked to an identity.
