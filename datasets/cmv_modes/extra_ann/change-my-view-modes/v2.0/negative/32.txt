[NEWLINE] For example, we could use the IQ scale ( for want of a better intelligence measure ) to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to.

[NEWLINE] Like, round the IQ to the nearest multiple of 50, then divide by 50, and that's the number of offspring you're allowed to create. 
[(0, '[NEWLINE]'), (1, 'Like'), (2, 'Ġ,'), (3, 'Ġround'), (4, 'Ġthe'), (5, 'ĠIQ'), (6, 'Ġto'), (7, 'Ġthe'), (8, 'Ġnearest'), (9, 'Ġmultiple'), (10, 'Ġof'), (11, 'Ġ50'), (12, 'Ġ,'), (13, 'Ġthen'), (14, 'Ġdivide'), (15, 'Ġby'), (16, 'Ġ50'), (17, 'Ġ,'), (18, 'Ġand'), (19, 'Ġthat'), (20, "'s"), (21, 'Ġthe'), (22, 'Ġnumber'), (23, 'Ġof'), (24, 'Ġoffspring'), (25, 'Ġyou'), (26, "'re"), (27, 'Ġallowed'), (28, 'Ġto'), (29, 'Ġcreate'), (30, 'Ġ.'), (31, 'Ġ')]
[NEWLINE] So someone with near average intelligence ( near 100 IQ, 75-124 ) would have their IQ rounded to 100 and then divided by 50 to make 2 offspring.
